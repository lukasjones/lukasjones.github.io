                Asking questions is always something I have needed to work on.  Whether it is in a social situation, where I get anxiety over whether or not it's  a dumb question, or in a solo situation when I get stuck on trying to figure it out myself.  It's an important skill to have and after some research I found some question asking skills I'd like to incorporate into my life.

                The first thing I need to start practicing is researching the question well.  I was just talking to one of my cohort buddies today and she thinks that we could all solve any question if we could access all of the amazing searching powers of Google.  I totally agree and if I find some extra time in the chaos that will be my life for the next 9 weeks, I'm definitely going to learn some of those tools!  Thoroughly researching questions before you ask them online is a great practice as well.  In said process, I usually learn a lot about what I'm trying to do that would have come up as questions later!

                The second thing I need to practice is actually voicing my thoughts no matter how stupid.  I'm a very self conscious person and feeling judged for my questions has always been something I've been scared of.  I hope to overcome this fear at DBC.  I'm really hoping that they don't force us to do too much to fast or I might go into a hole.

                I asked a couple questions on the google+ page and I definitely need to add more detail to my questions.  Some tips for myself would be add error messages to the question and maybe references to my code so people can see what's going on.  I'm going to try to make that a standard in the future.
