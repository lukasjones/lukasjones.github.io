          This was actually hard to choose a topic.  At first I didn't really know what to pick but after searching around a little bit the choices were all so interesting.  Definitely got lost down some internet rabbit holes on cyber friendships and ruby programming issues.  The topic that really hit home is actually something my dad is working on.  The standardization of technology in the education system.

          Data shows that there is a huge gap in the amount of people who can program and the amount of jobs that require someone with programming skills.  There isn't a standardized set of computer courses throughout schools that will create the technologically well versed people we need in the job force.  That being said, people are working on fixing it.

          There is an article about how Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg have donated a combination of nine million dollars to the cause of creating faster internet connection for kids at school.  A big part of the problem is funding.  We just can't afford to have every kid have a personal device but, they are trying to get there with estimations of achieving their goal by 2017.  It sounds idealistic to me but I think it's a good goal.

          Personally, I think it's nice that there will be jobs for me when I get out into the field, but I do see the problem in terms of society.  Our world is getting more and more technologically advanced and if we don't start producing more people who fit into that world I think something will break.  Whether that be the economy or the technology, who knows but it won't be good...
