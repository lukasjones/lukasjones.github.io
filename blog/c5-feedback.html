          Peer pairing has been the most useful learning tool I have used while partaking in phase 0.  I find that when you can bounce ideas off of people, it's much easier to differentiate the stupid ideas from the brilliant ones.  The social dynamic is also really nice.  Coding alone is fun because you are totally in control but it gets a little old after a while.  It's more entertaining and thought provoking to work with a partner.  Especially when you are both bouncing ideas off of each other!  It's definitely hard sometimes too though.  Establishing a driver and navigator in the beggining and sticking to your guns about your plan is something that my pairing could include more of.  I try hard to play my role but sometimes my partners get excited and forget and it's kind of awkward and frustrating to have to reel them back in.  Also sometimes I feel like I am understanding the concepts faster than my partner and I want to go, go, go but I totally get that accomodating to your partner is good for both of you and I definitely would want someone who is faster than me to be accomodating too.

          Based of off reading the reviews people have given me, I see a pattern of people telling me that I am quiet and could do to speak up a little more.  They think that I have good input when I do speak but that sometimes it feels like I am holding back.  The other main point is learning to better explain my thoughts.  Sometimes I am flustered in the beggining of my pairing sessions and it takes me a while to get in a flow but once I do, I think my wording gets better and my statements are a little more concise.  I will definitely work on getting into that flow state earlier.  The more practice, the better my skills will get so I look forward to getting better!

          Writing feedback was really hard in the beginning!  Looking for people's flaws has been something I actively tried to avoid in life.  Mostly because I prefer to focus on the good and it's not really my business to try to fix other people's issues.  That being said, as the weeks have gone by, I have found it easier to think of things that people can work on and write it in a way that doesn't make them want to punch me in the face. It was definitely the hardest part of the feedback writing process and still is though.

          Overall, peer pairing is the reason I joined a bootcamp in the first place.  Learning the mechanics and social responsibilities of working with other programmers is, in my opinion, so important to becoming a good programmer.  I also find working with people who are equally stoked on programming is worth so much! They keep the excitement level up and you get to make friends along the way!  This program is already everything I wanted it to be and I'm so excited to see where it takes me.  So to sum up, peer programming is the bee's knees.
