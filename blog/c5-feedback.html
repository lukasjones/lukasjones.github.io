          Peer pairing has been the most useful learning tool I have used while partaking in phase 0.  I find that when you can bounce ideas off of people, it's much easier to differentiate the stupid ideas from the brilliant ones.  The social dynamic is also really nice.  Coding alone is fun because you are totally in control but it gets a little old after a while.  It's more entertaining and thought provoking to work with a partner.  Especially when you are both bouncing ideas off of each other!  It's definitely hard sometimes too though.  Establishing a driver and navigator in the beggining and sticking to your guns about your plan is something that my pairing could include more of.  I try hard to play my role but sometimes my partners get excited and forget and it's kind of awkward and frustrating to have to reel them back in.  Also sometimes I feel like I am understanding the concepts faster than my partner and I want to go, go, go but I totally get that accomodating to your partner is good for both of you and I definitely would want someone who is faster than me to be accomodating too.

          Based of off reading the reviews people have given me, I see a pattern of people telling me that I am quiet and could do to speak up a little more.  They think that I have good input when I do speak but that sometimes it feels like I am holding back to them.  The other main point is learning to better explain my thoughts.  Sometimes I am flustered in the beggining of my pairing sessions and it takes me a while to get in a flow but once I do, I think my wording gets better and my statements are a little more concise.
