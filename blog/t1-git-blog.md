version control, git and git hub

11/20/2014

Version control is used to manage the organization of a project like a set of text files for example.  So when you work with multiple people and everyone is working on and editing the text files.  Some people might make changes to the same thing and when they copy and paste their copy over the old copy (because he doesn't want to hand type it in) other people who have already edited this file's work may get overwritten.  This happens because they didn't check if the version they were working on matched the version they pasted over. This is where version control comes in.  It makes sure that the version you are working on is up to date and it will also make sure that when you are merging your copy with the main copy that you don't unknowingly overwrite someone else's work!  Very cool if you ask me.

Git helps you track your changes by monitoring the files in a repository which is essentially the folder all your files and subfolders are in.  When you make a change to a file, like edit a title of the page or add a new file, it recognizes that you made a change and makes a note of it.  When you have made all the changes you want to for the current session, you can then write git status to see what you changed.

GitHub is an amazing tool to have because it keeps all of your work on a website that you can access from anywhere.  This makes collaborating with people super simple.  All you have to do is send them the link and they can copy your project and start working on it.  When they are done, all they have to do is send a pull request (a request to merge the changes made to the project) which will then be approved by the owner of the project.
