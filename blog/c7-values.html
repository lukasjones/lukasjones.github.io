          This week I'm going to write to you about the values that are importan to me.  This is a follow up of last weeks blog which was about stereotype threat.  Apparently, on of the things you can do to combat stereotype threat is affirmation or knowing the values that are important to you and being true to them.

          The values that resonate most strongly for me when I'm feeling proud or happy are accomplishment, Challenge, Compassion, Courage, Empathy, Friendship, Inspiration, Personal Developement, Tranquility, Adventure, Efficiency, Helping others, Self-reliance, Will-power.  There are definitely more but these are the ones that really pump me up.  I would say 50% of the time I live up to these values and the other 50% is spent trying to live up to them.

          The value that probably resonates with me the most is compassion.  It's something that I've always believed is the answer to so many of life's problems.  Some of the best and purpose filled experiences I have had in my life lie in the wake of compassionate action.  My friend recently came to me with the question "What do I do now?".  She is lost in life as I am lost in life.  She's looking for something meaningful and I didn't have an answer for her.  All I could do was say that it's OK to feel that way, that I'm here to talk about it and that she's not alone.  I'm not always compassionate and I admit to that but it only means that I have something to strive to be more of.

          Strong values definitely have the potential to mediate stereotype threat.  I could see believing strongly in your own will-power crushing the stereotype threat that you're not as smart as another group.  Believing strongly in courage could crush the stereotype of being racist by letting you not be afraid that you will act diferently with different people.  I totally understand where Claude Steele was coming from and I think he's spot on!

          Don't really know how to wrap this one up so... Till next time!
