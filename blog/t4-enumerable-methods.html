          This week I chose to study the Enumerable method: #group_by because it was the method that made I understood the least.  #group_by is a method that turns it's input into a hash.  Typically you use range of numbers as the object you are calling the method on and then you pass the method an argument like i % 4.  This will return a hash where the answer will be the key and the values that you would plug into i to get the answers are stored seperately in an array.  If you look down, I've included a coding example.
        </p>
        <code>
          (1..8).group_by{|i| i % 4 } # => {1=>[1, 5], 2=>[2, 6], 3=>[3, 7], 0=>[4, 8]}
        </code>
        <p>
          Having experimented with the code a little bit, it looks like there are a bunch of ways you could use this command.  if you plug in an i > 5 than it will return a hash with two keys false and true.  False has all the numbers less than 5 and true has all the numbers greater than 5.  You could also use this method to find out the times tables of different  numbers like i * 9 will give you the keys as the answer(9=>[1], 18=>[2] ...).
