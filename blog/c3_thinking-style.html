          When we started week 1, I had a negative emotional experience that made it really hard to focus and stay motivated.  As the weeks are going by, I'm getting better (more focused and motivated and emotionally stable) and the content is getting harder so it's working out.  Aside from this, the hardest part has been getting comfortable socializing with strangers and exposing my insecurities.

          I think meditation and exposure have been really key to overcoming some of these barriers.  My Gregorc thinking style is Abstract Random which really does fit my personality.  I definitely do not thrive in a competitive work environment and I definitely enjoy learning with projects that I can personalize.  Alot of it fits for me, but a lot of the other styles fit pretty well too so I don't think I will be limiting my learning to just one category.

          The plan to make things better is to use pairing sessions to really explore the different learning styles.  If my partner is more concrete sequential, then I will adhere a little more to their learning style. I think this will be beneficial to solidfying my understanding of concepts.  I strive to have a growth mindset as much as possible!  I think that the ideas mentioned before will be beneficial in keeping the growth mindset.  In addition to that, I plan to find some other activity that I can use to de-stress after a day of coding so that I can keep my mind in balance.
