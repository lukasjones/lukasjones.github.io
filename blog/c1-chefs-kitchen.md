Challenge 11

11/21/2014

The DBC experience explained by Shereef is both awe inspiring and intimidating.  I believe in the mission of making this the best experience for you personally and helping others to achieve that goal for themselves.  My impression is that the people who come to this school are interested and excited about learning and that's exactly what I was hoping for when I signed up.

I see myself struggling in the beginning to open up about what I don't know.  I've been working on my own for a while now and I've been relying solely on my own ability to comprehend and learn.  It's definitely going to be an adjustment.  A good adjustment though and I'm very excited to make it happen.

I had my first peer pairing session today and I was super nervous!  I didn't know what to expect but it turned out great!  We both took turns driving and navigating and by the end of the session I felt like I had gained so much more than if I had done the challenge alone.  All in all, I'm just super stoked to be here and now I can't wait to pair with the rest of you!
