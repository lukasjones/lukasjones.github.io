Challenge 11

11/21/2014

The DBC experience explained by Shereef is both awe inspiring and intimidating.  I believe in the mission of making this the best experience for you personally and helping others to achieve that goal for themselves.  My impression is that the people who come to this school are interested and excited about learning and that's exactly what I was hoping for when I signed up.

I see myself struggling in the beginning to open up about what I don't know.  I've been working on my own for a while now so it's definitely going to be a transition into being more social.  I am very excited and nervous to participate in this environment.
