          Today I'm going to write about stereotype threat.  What is stereotype threat you ask?  Good question.  Stereotype threat is the danger that a negative stereotype can influence the outcome of certain situations in a bad way.  For example, If you are in a group that is stereotyped at being worse at science than another group and you do a test with that in mind.  Your fear of fulfilling that stereotype can actually make you do worse on the test than you would if there were no stereotype.

          Personally I haven't knowingly felt the affects stereotype threats with regards to academics but I think I've felt them in other aspects of my life.  The talk that Claude Steele gave gives an example of white people being stereotyped as racist and I have definitely tried hard not to conform to that stereotype.  Sometimes though, in trying to avoid something, you overthink things and end up being the thing you were trying to avoid.  The middle school I went to was pretty tough and I was not.  There were a lot of fights that broke out and the majority of people fighting were black.  Thus I developed an almost overly friendly attitude with black people that I wouldn't have had if I wasn't afraid of the stereotype I had created in my mind.  I have mostly overcome my irrational fear nowadays but sometimes I wonder if I'm treating some people better than others.

          My whole life I've tried to treat everyone the same.  That was how I was raised and I think for the most part I do a pretty good job.  That being said, there are some stereotypes that I listen to.  I bike to a climbing gym near an asian mall and I am much more aware of the driving there which has saved me from some pretty serious crashes.  I know it's dangerous to judge people without getting to know them first but I don't think that you should just throw out all stereotypes at all times.  I guess my rule of thumb is when you are meeting someone for the first time they get a clean slate.  No stereotypes, no cover judging just honest getting to know them.  However, when you are dealing with people out in the day to day you have to keep some stereotypes in the back of your head so you can avoid potentially dangerous situations.  Every time I try to have this conversation with people they poo poo me for validating stereotypes but I think it's important to use common sense and not just throw out everything you have learned in the world.
