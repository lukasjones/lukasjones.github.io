          Version control is awesome for many reasons.  You can work on a project and make commits(save points) along the way that store that version of the project at that time.  This is cool because if you get a bug in your program that you don't know how to fix, you can always go back to a previous version of the code that does work.  Version control also makes it much easier for many people to work on a project and not overwrite the work of the others.  It also makes it really hard to lose your project because there are so many people who have working versions of your project and if your using an online version control website, you also have access to your project there.

          Git helps you track your changes by monitoring the files in a repository which is essentially the folder all your files and subfolders are in.  When you make a change to a file, like edit a title of the page or add a new file, it recognizes that you made a change and makes a note of it.  When you have made all the changes you want to for the current session, you can then write git status to see what you changed.  You can then save (commit) that work so the computer remembers that version of the project at that point in time with the command git commit -m "commit message".  You can also use git commit -v which opens the commit message up in a text editor.

          GitHub is an amazing tool to have because it keeps all of your work on a website that you can access from anywhere.  This makes collaborating with people super simple.  All you have to do is send them the link and they can copy your project and start working on it.  When they are done, all they have to do is send a pull request (a request to merge the changes made to the project) which will then be approved or denied by the owner of the project depending on if your contribution is worthy.  When you store your code on Github, you can use an open source license to allow other people to use and build off your project which opens a up a lot of potential!
