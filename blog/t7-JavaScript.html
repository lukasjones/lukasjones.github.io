          We started learning JavaScript this week and one of the first things I noticed (coming from Ruby) is the lack of preprogrammed methods in JavaScript.  In Ruby there are hundreds of pre programmed methods for arrays and hashes and strings and there are lots of different ways to do different things.  In Javascript, it seems like there aren't nearly as many options.  It's definitely taking some getting used to.

          As opposed to Ruby, JavaScript has many methods for manipulating the DOM.  If you don't know what Manipulating the DOM is, here is a brief explanation.  The DOM stands for the Document Object Model with is a representation of the html elements on your page in a sort of tree like structure.  Basically it shows them in a way where you can see which elements are parents and which elements are children.  Manipulating the DOM means changing something in the DOM.  For example if you had an ul with an id of "list" you could select that ul using the .getElementByID method and change something about it like the inner html or the style applied to it.  This creates a really cool dynamic functionality where you can write functions that do things and make those things happen when events happen like a click or a hover.  Its cool to be learning it so we can combine these tools on our rails apps.

          I look forward to diving deeper in to JavaScript through out these next weeks and understanding better why it's structured the way it is.
