          We started learning JavaScript this week and one of the first things I noticed (coming from Ruby) is the lack of preprogrammed methods in JavaScript.  In Ruby there are hundreds of pre programmed methods and lots of different ways to do different things but there doesn't seem to be very many in JavaScript.

          When I look at the documentation, there seems to be a lot more aboue how to manipulate the DOM as opposed to manipulating arrays or objects.   I guess that's why we're learning it so we can combine the tools on our rails apps.  Maybe there are some JavaScript libraries out there that will extend the JavaScript capabilities a little bit more.
        </p>

          I look forward to diving deeper in to JavaScript through out these next weeks and understanding better why it's structured the way it is.
