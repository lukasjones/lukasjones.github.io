          The topic today is conflict.  So let me tell you about one I had once and then we can analyze what I did and whether or not I responded to the situation in a good way.

          Once upon a time, I had a roommate who got a puppy with his girlfriend (who also lived with us).  This puppy was a pitbull boxer mix which they named America.  To my dismay, my roommate and his girlfriend did not actually like training the dog.  They just wanted to have something cute but training it to poop and pee outside was apparently not on their puppy having schedule.  Naturally after stepping in multiple dukies (in shoes and bare feet) I was fed up.  I had let them know about the dukie incidents but I hadn't told them how it made me feel so I let them know how frustrating it was and that they needed to take better care of their dog.  They didn't seem to care about my frustrations though. I ended up trying to train the dog which yielded some results but was equally frustrating because I had not signed up for that.  By the time I moved out nothing had changed significantly except for my ability to avoid stepping in poops.

          If I could go back, I would do a couple things differently.  For one, I would have had a talk with them before they got the dog and explained what that means in terms of training a puppy and respecting the shared space that we all have to occupy.  I also would have set up some ground rules.  From this experience, I learned that some people should not get dogs and if you don't tackle the problem right from the beginning, you might end up in a poopy situation...
